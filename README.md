This is my SDLC repo

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- In order for a smooth transition to happen from start to end for a project, the Product Owner definitely plays the most important role to make sure the team is updated and aligned with client's needs and any changes in requirements are immediately delivered to the team. Creating user stories from the product backlog helps to separate the whole project into several pieces and split into different Scrums. The whole team will be able to digest the whole project piece by piece in stead of devouring the entirety.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-  The first step is to understand the project and delegate leadership roles based on everyone's capability. The Scrum Master and the Produce Owner are the critical roles in order to ensure the team understand the big picture of the project. Then the team will work together by developing and testing the program to make sure the final deliverable is satisfactory. In my future development work, I would like to use Kanban agile process--a process which provides the whole team with very clear categories on a whiteboard with specific columns: Current Sprint, To Do, Done, Questions. Daily Scrum standups could be discussed based on the information on the Kanban board and updated accordingly.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- When we talk about team integration and good team work, everyone in a team is a critical part of the whole team. To become a good team member, transparency and communications should be well-established at the early stage of any Scrums. No matter what role we are playing, we should not only accomplish what is assigned to us but also make sure that the whole team is running smoothly. If we are pretty handy with our responsibilities, we could offer helps to other team members to relieve their burdens, and in the future they might be able to help us as well. Establishing trust and mutual respect is the key to becoming a good team member.
